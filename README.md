# Pensive

Notetaking software, heavily inspired by Obsidian and Notion, with some minor tweaks to support my style of notetaking during research and data exploration.

It's often useful to be able to arbitrarily narrow or expand the scope of the notes in view at any given time, making it easier to do focused work without getting distracted by notes that aren't currently relevant.
Pensive has a few key features that I was unable to find all together in other notetaking software:

- Notes are presented as a graph rather than as folders and files
- Flexible system for traversing the graph, including which notes are highlighted or hidden
- The full history is always stored, including the creation times of, and edits to, each note
- Images, files, and references to other parts of the graph are stored on notes directly
- Keyboard-based navigation, with multiple tabs and tab groups
